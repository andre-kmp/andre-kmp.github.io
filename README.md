This repository contains the source code of my personal website, hosted via **GitHub Pages**.

I have always wanted to build a **professional and personal hub** that brings together my portfolio, case studies, articles, and contact information. Over the past few years, I tried several different services, but each of them was missing something. A static site on GitHub Pages brings the best of all worlds (simplicity, privacy, free hosting, and a cool URL) while also allowing detailed customization (through front-end development), which is something I highly value, even as a data scientist.

I plan to add the case studies and have the website ready by **September 6th, 2025**.
